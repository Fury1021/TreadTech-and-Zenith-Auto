# TreadTech-and-Zenith-Auto

Welcome to TreadTech-and-Zenith-Auto! This project bridges the gap between retailers and companies, making it easy for retailers to purchase products and resell them to their own customers. Our platform is designed to be both robust and flexible, thanks to a microservices architecture that keeps things organized and scalable.

## Project Overview

TreadTech-and-Zenith-Auto is split into two main systems:

- **TreadTech (Admin System):** For admins to manage products and keep track of the business side.

## System Architecture

This project uses a **microservices approach**, which means each part of the system is its own service. It keeps things simple to manage and easy to update as the platform grows.

Here’s a quick look at how it’s structured:

```
+--------------------------+      +---------------------+
|      TreadTech Admin     | <--> |   Database Service  |
+--------------------------+      +---------------------+
             |
             | (APIs)
             v
+--------------------------+
|   ZenithAuto (Retailer)  |
+--------------------------+
```

- **TreadTech:** Handles everything for administrators.
- **ZenithAuto:** Handles everything for retailers and customers, communicating through secure APIs.
- **Database Service:** Stores all products, customers, and order data.
