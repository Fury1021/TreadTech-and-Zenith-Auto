# TreadTech-and-Zenith-Auto
Retailer and Company relationship, whereas the retailer buys product from a company and sells them to its customers.

  Our project is built using a microservices architecture, which allows us to break down the system into independent services. This approach significantly improves scalability and maintainability. The key services include Product, Payment, Order, and User Account services. The web app accesses these services via an API gateway and incorporates Facebook and Google authentication, as well as PayPal for payments. There are two main systems within the project: the admin system, known as TreadTech, and the retailer/customer system, known as ZenithAuto.   
  
  The admin system (TreadTech) does not utilize APIs but provides robust functionalities for administrators. Admins can add, edit, delete, and download products/tires. They can also view customers' order logs, access a comprehensive list of customers, and check tire types. The search function within the admin system is highly efficient, specifically in the "All Tires" page, where the search results are filtered to display only the products/tires that can be downloaded upon clicking the download button.   
  
  On the other hand, the retailer/customer system (ZenithAuto) operates solely through APIs. This system allows customers and retailers to view products/tires, add items to their cart, view their order logs, and proceed with checkout using either local checkout or the PayPal API. Additionally, in the "All Tires" section, retailers can upload a CSV file that they have previously downloaded from the admin's "All Tires" page. This functionality enhances the overall user experience by providing seamless integration and efficient management of products and orders.
